# Project Name : PC Forge #

1. Live Website Link : https://pc-forge.vercel.app/


## Description ##
In this project I built an application to build a PC by choosing components. To build a PC, you need to verify yourself by verification on login page or otherwise you can only see the components and roam around. Now after login you can get the access of `PC Forge` page where you can see the category and you have to go through each category and select the components. **Note that you can choose each important components only once**. The Contact page is not functional, it is made for UI only. Though this project is focused only for frontEnd but the data you are going to see is coming from a specific backend for this project.
